**Description:** 

The increase of users and high network requirements have led to the introduction of millimeter wave technology in order to increase data transfer speeds and minimize delays. The transition to the millimeter wave band in 5G imposes new features in the implementation of services. In this work the mathematical model has been developed to describe the process of servicing multicast traffic using the methods of queuing theory. Signal propagation features are taken into account by dividing the coverage area into two areas: circle and ring. The constructed mathematical model makes it possible to find analytical expressions for calculating the loss probability of multicast connections and the amount of occupied resource in various areas.
